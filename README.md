# Skeuomorphic Toggle Switch

This repository contains HTML and CSS code for creating a skeuomorphic toggle switch. A skeuomorphic design is an approach that imitates the look and feel of real-world objects. In this case, we're mimicking the appearance of a physical toggle switch using HTML and CSS.

## How to Use

To use this toggle switch in your HTML document, follow these simple steps:

1. Include the `style.css` file in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

2. Add the toggle switch HTML code to your document where you want the toggle switch to appear. You can add multiple switches as needed:

```html
<div class="toggle-wrapper">
    <input class="toggle-checkbox" type="checkbox">
    <div class="toggle-container">
        <div class="toggle-button">
            <div class="toggle-button-circles-container">
                <!-- Twelve toggle-button-circle elements go here -->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Make sure to include the necessary HTML structure for each toggle switch.

3. Customize the appearance (optional): You can customize the toggle switch's appearance by modifying the CSS in the `style.css` file. Adjust colors, sizes, and shadows to match your design preferences.

4. Enjoy your skeuomorphic toggle switch! When you view your HTML document in a web browser, you'll see the toggle switch in action.

## CSS Classes

- `.toggle-wrapper`: The outer container for the toggle switch.
- `.toggle-checkbox`: The hidden checkbox input used for toggling the switch.
- `.toggle-container`: The container for the switch's background and button.
- `.toggle-button`: The button that slides left and right to represent the switch state.
- `.toggle-button-circles-container`: The container for the small circles inside the button.
- `.toggle-button-circle`: The small circles that give the button its skeuomorphic appearance.

## Styling

The CSS in `style.css` provides a base design for the toggle switch. You can customize various aspects such as colors, sizes, and transitions by editing the CSS rules to match your specific needs.
